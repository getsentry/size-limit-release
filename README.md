# size-limit-release

This is a Github Action tied to [size-limit-action](https://github.com/getsentry/size-limit-action) which can be used to add size limit information to a Github release.

## Usage

```yml
name: Add size info to release
on:
  release:
    types:
      - published

# This workflow is triggered when a release is published
# It fetches the size-limit info from the release branch and adds it to the release
jobs:
  release-size-info:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    name: 'Add size-limit info to release'
    steps:
      # https://github.com/actions-ecosystem/action-regex-match
      - uses: actions-ecosystem/action-regex-match@v2
        id: head_version
        with:
          # Parse version from head ref, which is refs/tags/<tag_name>
          text: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          regex: '^refs\/tags\/([\d.]+)$'

      - name: Get version
        id: get_version
        run: echo "version=${{ steps.head_version.outputs.match }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Update Github Release
        uses: getsentry/size-limit-release@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          version: ${{ steps.get_version.outputs.version }}
          workflow_name: 'build.yml'
```

Note that this will not do anything if it detects that size limit information has already been added to the release.
